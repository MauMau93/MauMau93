Hi there 👋

✏️ What am I doing now?

At the moment I'm working on my Final Master Project to finish my masters in Statistics for Data Science, in Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. You can take a peek at it: I am trying to get a more efficient estimator for poverty measures in small areas.

I am also a professor in Universidad ORT, where I teach "Economics and Uruguayan Society", a subject focused on macroeconomics. Since classes are now back to normal, I am only working there assisting other professors when needed, as I had recolated to Madrid.

In my free time I research interesting blockchain/cryptocurrency things, play piano,read books and occasionally play soccer.
